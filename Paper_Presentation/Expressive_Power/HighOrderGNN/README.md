# Provably Powerful Graph Networks

## Background and Motivation

Popular message passing GNN cannot distinguish between graphs that cannot be distinguished by the 1-WL test, while many simple graphs are indistinguishable by the 1-WL test. Therefore, it demands to develop more powerful graph networks that can provably enjoy higher expressiveness. Recently, it has the shown that the k-order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks can be possibly more powerful than messagge passing GNNs. Based on this idea, this paper construct a new GNN model that provably achieves the same expressiveness as the 3-WL test.


## Contributions and Results
* This paper proves that there exists a k-order GNN that can be as powerful as the k-WL test.
* This paper builds a provably stronger, simple and scalable model which has a provable 3-WL expressive power.
* In experiments, the proposed GNN model has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on popular graph classification and regression tasks.
