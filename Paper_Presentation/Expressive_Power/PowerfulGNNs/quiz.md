## Question 1. (Multi-choice)

Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN):

A. is provably as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test.

B. is the most expressive among the class of GNNs.

C. uses 1-layer perceptrons for the neighbor aggregation. 

## Question 2. (Ture/False)

The paper considers only the case where the input node features are from a countable set


## Question 3. (Ture/False)

According to experimental results, GIN-ε with learnable parameter ε can better fit the training data and demonstrate better generalization to test set compare with GIN-0 where ε is fixed to 0.
